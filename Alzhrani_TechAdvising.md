Project Relevance:

The idea of the project depends on providing an easier way for the students to keep track of their Academic schedule when it comes to finding which courses to register for or how far they are from graduation. Also, many people delay their graduation, because of a course they didn't know is required. This program will reduce the recurrence of this issue, especially in the case of busy advising appointments. 

Conceptual Design: 

By using Android Studio to create the app, and the use of SQL is required because of the large amounts of data, the app will store. Java is the language that will be used for programming this project which going to include many lists and trees to store the requirement of the courses.
